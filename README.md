# Biazon, Gian Alfred V. Programming Assignment #1
The repository contains solutions to identify the basic codes and functions in Python Programming, solving three different problems.
to create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order,
to create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad, and mad with their corresponding emoticon, and
to create a function that unpacks the list into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.
