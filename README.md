# Biazon, Gian Alfred V. Programming Assignment #1
The repository contains solutions to identify the basic codes and functions in Python Programming, solving three different problems.



Problem #1 - ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM 
                - to create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.
                
Example output :     alphabet_soup("hello") = ehllo
                     alphabet_soup("hacker") = acehkr

Problem #2 - EMOTICON PROBLEM
                - to create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin,                    sad, and mad with their corresponding emoticon.

                WORD       EMOTICON
                Smile          :)
                Grin           :D
                Sad            :((
                Mad            >:(
                
Example output :    emotify("Make me smile") = Make me :)
                    emotify("I am mad") = I am >:(

                    
Problem #3 - UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM 
                - to create a function that unpacks the list into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything                     in between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.


Example output:     1st = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
                    Output: first: 1       middle: [2,3,4,5]        last: 6
